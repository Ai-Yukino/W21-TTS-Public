# Other notes

Hey, I noticed when you were changing code you weren't using a certain shortcut. You may already know but I'm sharing in case you don't...

CTRL + [Right Arrow | Left Arrow]

Instead of mousing through characters, you can mouse past blocks of characters separated by spaces and most special characters.

I use fixing code, web addresses, if I am highlighting text on a site I'll highlight one word then hold CTRL + Shift + [Right Arrow]

---

Also,

WINDOWS + [Up Arrow] will maximize a screen instead of using the mouse to get to the corner of the screen
