# Cal's notes

React is library for building UI.  
React is not a framework.
Frameworks vs. libraries:  
Frameworks make smart decisions for you so you can focus on writing application logic.
On the other hand, if you have a bigger codebase or have more experience, you might graduate from using premade framework.

Native DOM: Single-DOM.
It can only handle one expensive option at a time (i.e. single thread)
Virtual DOM: only update things that change
